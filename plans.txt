Roguelike text based game
Enemies are chosen at random
PlayerData table is to keep track of runs
enemies table is queried for legnth, randint selected between 1 and said legnth, enemy chosen from that row.
during battle: you can either attack or heal by a random value
need to expand on cli arguments, maybe commands to add custom enemies and classes?
    make sure custom enemy/class commands can be added mid-game (probably by executing the file in a separate terminal)
